# SentimentAnalysis-Airline
This repository contains an Airline Sentiment Analysis project utilizing both traditional Machine Learning models and the BERT contextual model.
The aim is to classify tweets about airlines into sentiment categories (positive, neutral, and negative).

## Project Overview
The project involves:

### Dataset: 
The dataset consists of tweets about airlines, labeled with sentiment categories. It is sourced from the Crowdflower Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset.
### Data Preprocessing: 
Includes cleaning and preprocessing text data to remove noise such as punctuation, emojis, and irrelevant information.
### Model Training:
#### Machine Learning Models: 
Implementation of various traditional ML models like Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree.
#### BERT Model: 
Fine-tuning and implementation of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for sentiment analysis.
### Evaluation: 
Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.
